-- Assignment (Questions with Answers)

1.   What is a parameter? 
Ans- A parameter is a value learned by the machine
    learning model during training (example: weights and bias).

2.  What is correlation? 
Ans-Correlation is a measure that shows how
    strongly two variables are related.

3.  What does negative correlation mean? 
Ans-Negative correlation means when
    one variable increases, the other decreases.

4.  Define Machine Learning. 
Ans-What are the main components in Machine
    Learning? Machine Learning is a method that allows computers to
    learn patterns from data and make decisions. Main components: Data,
    Model, Loss Function, Optimizer.

5.  How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or
    not? 
Ans- Low loss value means the model is good. High loss value means
    the model is performing poorly.

6.  What are continuous and categorical variables?
Ans-   Continuous variables:
    Numerical values that can be measured. Categorical variables: Values
    that represent categories.

7.  How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are
    the common techniques? 
Ans- Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal
    Encoding, Binary Encoding.

8.  What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?
Ans-    Training dataset
    is used to teach the model. Testing dataset is used to check its
    performance.

9.  What is sklearn.preprocessing? 
Ans-   It is a module in scikit-learn used
    for scaling, encoding, and transforming data.

10. What is a Test set? 
Ans-    A test set is used to evaluate the final
    performance of the model on unseen data.

11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in
    Python? 
Ans-   Using train_test_split() function.

12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?
Ans-    Understand → Collect
    → Clean → EDA → Feature Engineering → Model Selection → Train →
    Evaluate.

13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?
Ans- EDA helps detect missing values, outliers, correlations, and data
    patterns.

14. What is correlation?
Ans- Measures how two variables move together.

15. What does negative correlation mean?
Ans- When one variable goes up, the
    other goes down.

16. How can you find correlation between variables in Python? 
Ans-    Using
    df.corr()

17. What is causation? 
Ans-   Explain difference between correlation and
    causation. Causation means one variable directly affects another.
    Correlation means variables are related but do not cause each other.

18. What is an Optimizer? Types? 
Ans- Optimizer updates model parameters to
    reduce loss. Types: Gradient Descent, SGD, Adam, RMSprop.

19. What is sklearn.linear_model?
Ans-    Module containing linear models like
    Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

20. What does model.fit() do? 
Ans-    Trains the model using X and y.

21. What does model.predict() do? 
Ans-     Predicts output using X_test.

22. Continuous and categorical variables? 
Ans- (Repeated) Same definitions.

23. What is feature scaling? 
Ans- Standardizing numerical features to similar
    ranges.

24. How do we perform scaling in Python? 
Ans- Using StandardScaler or
    MinMaxScaler.

25. Explain data encoding. 
Ans- Converting categorical values to numerical.
